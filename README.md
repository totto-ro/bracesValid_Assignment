# Braces Valid

Objectives:

Exercise those logic muscles!

Use data structures (arrays, objects) effectively to complete the challenge.

Given a string, write a function that will determine whether the braces  - including parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly brackets {} - within the string are valid. That means that any braces within other braces must close before the outer set closes.
